Ingredients
1.3 kg free-range chicken
3 sprigs of fresh thyme
4 cloves of garlic
1 teaspoon sweet smoked paprika
olive oil
2 red onions
4 ripe mixed-colour tomatoes
6 fresh mixed-colour chillies
red wine vinegar
extra virgin olive oil
SWEET POTATO WEDGES
750 g sweet potatoes
1 teaspoon smoked paprika
2 tablespoons  ne semolina
JALAPEÑO SALSA
1 x 200 g jar of pickled jalapeños
1 bunch of fresh coriander
Method
1. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the chicken in half along the
backbone.
2. Pick the thyme leaves into a pestle and mortar, peel and add 1
garlic clove, then add the paprika and a pinch of sea salt. Bash to a
paste, then muddle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
3. Rub the marinade all over the chicken, making sure to get into all
the nooks and crannies. Cover and place in the fridge to marinate
for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.
4. When you’re ready to cook, preheat the oven to 180ºC/350ºF/gas 4.
Place a large griddle pan over a high heat.
5. Quarter the unpeeled onions and halve any larger tomatoes, then
place on the hot griddle with the chillies and the remaining
unpeeled garlic cloves. Grill for 5 to 10 minutes, or until charred all
over, turning regularly.
6. Remove the garlic skins and peel the onions, then add all the
vegetables to a food processor with a splash of red wine vinegar
and a good lug of extra virgin olive oil. Blitz until smooth, then add
a splash of water to loosen, if needed. Season to taste.
7. Return the griddle pan to a high heat, add the marinated chicken
and sear all over for 8 to 10 minutes, turning regularly. Transfer to a
roasting tray, then pop in the hot oven for 45 minutes, or until
cooked through.
8. Meanwhile, cut the sweet potatoes into rough 2cm wedges. Toss
with the paprika, semolina, a small pinch of salt and black pepper
and a lug of olive oil.
9. Spread the wedges out on 2 large baking trays, then place in the
oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until tender and crisp.
10. To make the jalapeño salsa, drain and add the jalapeños to a food
processor with a splash of the pickling juice. Tear in the coriander
